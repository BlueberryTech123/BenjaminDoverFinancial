                If you actually read this you'd feel like something's off about this website. Otherwise you're a dumbass, who doesn't realize he's being duped and thinks Benjamin Dover Financial is a real bank. Short for Benjamin Dover is Ben Dover, which is just "Bend Over". Haha get it? BEND over? Heheheheha. Did you know that Casa Martzu is the most dangerous cheese, as it literally is rotten and has maggots in it? By the way, amogus is not funny anymore. Same is the case for Mr. Incredible becoming (something) memes. Seriously, those aren't funny, stop overmilking it.<br>
                Can I put my balls, way down deep inside your jaw? Won’t you let me shove my balls inside your gaping maw? In other words, suck my nuts. In other words, slurp these testes
                <br>Fill your jaw with my balls, and you will smile forever more. Balls are all you’ll long for all you’ll worship and adore. In other words, eat my nads. In other words, swallow my sack<br>
                FUN FACT: Did you know someone wrote a childrens' book called "Dee's Big Nuts", a book by Mark Thunder? COol because he also created "Master Baiter" yee yee yee.
